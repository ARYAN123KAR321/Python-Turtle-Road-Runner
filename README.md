# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a simple Python game inspired by the classic Frogger game, where the player controls a turtle and tries to cross the road while avoiding moving cars. The game is built using the `turtle` module.

## Features
- Player-controlled turtle moves upwards to reach the finish line.
- Randomly generated cars move across the screen at increasing speeds.
- Score tracking system that increments when the player successfully crosses.
- Game over message when the turtle collides with a car.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.x). Then, clone the repository and run the game.

```sh
# Clone the repository
[git clone https://github.com/yourusername/turtle-crossing-game.git](https://github.com/ARYAN123KAR321/Python-Turtle-Road-Runner.git)
cd Python-Turtle-Road-Runner

# Run the game
python main.py
```

## How to Play
- Use the **Up Arrow Key** to move the turtle upwards.
- Avoid getting hit by the moving cars.
- Reach the top of the screen to level up and increase the difficulty.
- The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.

## File Structure
